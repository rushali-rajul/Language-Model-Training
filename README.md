# Language-Model-Training

Explanation of Key Steps

Data Preparation
A CustomTextDataset class was created to handle preprocessing tasks like reading the text file, cleaning the content, and tokenizing it with a pretrained tokenizer such as GPT-2.
Proper truncation and padding were applied to prepare the text data as input tensors suitable for model training.

Model Selection
GPT-2, a transformer-based model, was selected for its ability to handle causal language modeling tasks where text is generated sequentially in an autoregressive manner.

Training Loop
The training process utilized the AdamW optimizer for efficient weight updates and a linear learning rate scheduler to ensure smooth transitions in learning rates.
To enhance training efficiency, the script was designed to leverage GPU resources when available, while maintaining compatibility with CPU-based environments.

Model Saving
The fine-tuned model and tokenizer were saved locally for later use in applications like text generation or further fine-tuning.

Tools Used
PyTorch: Used as the framework for model training, loss computation, and optimization.
Hugging Face Transformers: Provided the pretrained GPT-2 model and tokenizer, enabling seamless integration with the training pipeline.
Custom Dataset Class: Designed to preprocess and tokenize custom text data effectively.

Challenges
Data Preparation
Ensuring clean, properly formatted text data without extraneous symbols or encoding errors was a critical challenge during preprocessing.
Hardware Limitations

Training a language model from scratch or fine-tuning requires significant computational power, often relying on GPUs or TPUs to handle large-scale operations.
Hyperparameter Optimization

Selecting appropriate hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and sequence length was essential to achieve a stable and efficient training process.
